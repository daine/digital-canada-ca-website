<p>An important part of delivering services that meet peoples’ diverse needs is ensuring inclusivity in our communications. This includes making sure we’re sharing information people can understand and use in both official languages (English and French).</p>



<p>We sat down with Chantal Turcotte, Director of Communications, currently on assignment at the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/privy-council/services/communications-community-office/about-communications-community-office.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Communications Community Office (CCO)</a> at the Privy Council Office (PCO). Chantal shared her thoughts on why inclusive communication is important, as well as some practical tips to help public servants develop their inclusive writing skills.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-working-at-cco"><strong>Working at CCO</strong></h2>



<p>Before I joined the CCO, I was Director of Communications and Linguistic Services at <a href="https://women-gender-equality.canada.ca/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Women and Gender Equality Canada (WAGE)</a>. In that role, I was surprised to see just how many people had questions about inclusive language.</p>



<p>It got me thinking: why didn’t the Government of Canada have a resource to help people be more inclusive in their writing? So I helped launch an interdepartmental working group on inclusive writing to take up the challenge. We now have members from over 36 departments from both federal and provincial governments! Through the work of this group, we were able to publish the <a href="https://www.noslangues-ourlanguages.gc.ca/en/writing-tips-plus/inclusive-writing-guidelines-resources.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inclusive writing – Guidelines and resources</a> in September 2022.</p>



<p>However, I realized that I didn’t want to stop at the guidelines; employees needed formal training. I was very lucky my Director General agreed to an assignment with the CCO to develop an inclusive writing course for public servants. The working group started working on the course this September and it’s progressing very well. I’ve also presented on inclusive writing at multiple conferences and events, including this year’s <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/privy-council/services/communications-community-office/learning-days/agenda.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CCO Learning Day.</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-writing-for-everyone-how-words-can-include-or-exclude"><strong>Writing for everyone: How words can include or exclude</strong></h2>



<p>Women and non-binary folks are invisible in language when we follow all the traditional masculine and feminine grammar rules. This creates a unicentric view of the world that’s very exclusionary. However, when we use inclusive language, we’re telling women and non-binary folks that we see them; that they’re part of the world.</p>



<p>I’m constantly inspired by my transgender daughter. She made me ask myself questions about gender and inclusion that I hadn’t thought to ask before. I’ve seen how her face lights up when someone uses her preferred pronouns when they’re talking with her. Words really are extremely powerful when it comes to acceptance and inclusion. She has been a great companion on this journey.</p>



<p>We have such a binary view of gender, but it’s really something fluid and people can express and identify their gender in diverse ways. It’s not static.</p>



<p>There are three main reasons why inclusive language is so important for public servants:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Canada’s population is gender-diverse, we need to write for all. </strong>According to the 2021 census, women make up <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/12-581-x/2022001/sec7-eng.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">50.9% of the population</a> of Canada. There are more women than men in Canada! Transgender and non-binary folks makeup <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/220427/dq220427b-eng.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">0.33%</a>. Therefore, women, transgender people, and non-binary folks form the majority of people in Canada. We need to write in a way that accurately reflects the people we serve.<br></li>



<li><strong>The way we speak reflects the way we see the world.</strong> Many of the grammar rules we use today were created 400 years ago in a male-dominated and male-centric world. The world has changed, but the language we use hasn’t. Historically, the male tense and male default was more important than including anyone who wasn’t a man. Inclusive writing shows that we’re moving past this outdated idea.&nbsp;<br>Language changes. For example, in English, we used to say ‘thou’, but eventually it was changed to ‘you’. It caused a scandal and stirred up people who felt very strongly that language shouldn’t change. But nowadays, we use ‘you’ far more often than we use ‘thou’.<br></li>



<li><strong>Language has a powerful impact.</strong> Pronouns say something about how someone sees themselves. Using the wrong one can be harmful. In fact, respect for gender identity and expression is now included in the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/h-6/section-3.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Canadian Human Rights Act</a>. Intentionally using the wrong pronoun is considered discrimination. We need to be able to speak to all gender identities and include them in what we do.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inclusivity-in-both-official-languages-nbsp"><strong>Inclusivity in both official languages&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Inclusive writing in French is often thought to be very complicated. It is a challenge, for sure, but definitely not an insurmountable one. There are simple solutions you can use to avoid using the masculine by default or gendered language at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, doublets are a widely-known alternative in French:&nbsp; you could&nbsp;write “Canadiennes et Canadiens” to include both the masculine and the feminine forms. Using collective nouns is another useful solution, as it includes not only women and men, but also non-binary people and people whose gender is unknown to the person writing. “La population canadienne” (“The Canadian population”) replaces the gendered term “Les Canadiens” (“Canadians”), “le personnel” (“the staff”) or “l’équipe” (“the team”) replaces the gendered term “les employés” (“the employees”). It’s also possible to use epicene, or non-gendered term. “Fonctionnaires” (“civil servants”) is one of them. It can be used with the masculine or feminine determiner: “un fonctionnaire” or “une fonctionnaire” are both valid options. In their plural form, these terms provide a major advantage: they include everyone. The <a href="https://vitrinelinguistique.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/25465/la-redaction-et-la-communication/feminisation-et-redaction-epicene/redaction-epicene/formulation-neutre/liste-de-termes-epicenes-ou-neutres" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Banque de dépannage linguistique of the Office québecois de la langue française</a> includes a list of epicene and neutral terms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tips-for-public-servants"><strong>Tips for public servants</strong></h2>



<ol>
<li><strong>Pluralize the noun.</strong><br>For example, instead of saying &#8220;The supervisor must give feedback to his/her employees monthly&#8221;, you can instead say “Supervisors must give feedback to their employees monthly”. By pluralizing the subject, we have avoided using he (il) or she (elle).&nbsp;<br></li>



<li><strong>Use shorter words and sentences.</strong><br>Don&#8217;t forget about plain language! Plain language is part of the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/privy-council/services/communications-community-office/communications-101-boot-camp-canadian-public-servants/plain-language-accessibility-inclusive-communications.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">government&#8217;s communications policy</a>. First, we need to be clear, then we can be inclusive.<br></li>



<li><strong>Address your audience directly.</strong><br>When writing to a person, write to them directly by saying “you” instead of “he/she”. For example, “The tenant must keep&nbsp;his&nbsp;apartment clean and tidy” becomes “You&nbsp;must keep&nbsp;your&nbsp;apartment clean and tidy”.&nbsp;<br></li>



<li><strong>Be mindful of your audience.</strong><br>Actively using inclusive language opens up a world of possibilities.&nbsp;<br>For example, research shows that when you write a job description, especially in French, ensuring you use both the masculine and feminine form of the job title results in more women applying for the position. For example, instead of only using administrateur (masculine), include administratrice (feminine) as well.&nbsp;CDSer Marie-Sophie Bézert wrote the blog <a href="https://digital.canada.ca/2023/03/20/writing-without-excluding-inclusivity-in-the-french-language/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Writing without excluding: Inclusivity in the French language</a> that has more guidance on writing job descriptions in French.<br></li>
